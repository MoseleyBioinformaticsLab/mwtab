Add --limit or --ignore option to validate to filter out certain types of errors/warnings. Need to first create some classifications to tag them with.

Think about extending METABOLITES and EXTENDED blocks with an "Attributes" line like "Factors" in DATA block as a way to add more information about the columns themselves.
Hunter also wanted to consider adding things like the _factors properties into the JSON as well. For example, the _factors could be added into ['MS_METABOLITE_DATA'] under a 'Factors' key.

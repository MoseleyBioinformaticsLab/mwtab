Add some information into the documentation about how some of the validations are pretty strict to account for the major of cases, 
but if warranted could be ignored. For example, COLUMN_PRESSURE in the CHROMATOGRAPHY section is looking for a single number or 
range of numbers followed by a unit, but there might be some situations where the method is complex and thus the column pressure 
is not static, so something like "60 bar at starting conditions. 180 bar at %A" would be the value.
